============================

These are the files for the Georgia Tech Software Tools Subsystem 'fmt'
formatter translated into C by Arnold Robbins.  The Ratfor version
was a much-improved version of the original formatter in the Software
Tools book.

I have not touched these files in close to 20 years, as evidenced by
the dates. I'm posting them to GitHub so that they'll be available for
anyone who is interested.
