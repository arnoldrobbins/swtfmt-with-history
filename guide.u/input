.MH "Input/Output Processing"
.#
.SH "Input File Control"
Up to this point, it has been assumed that 'swtfmt' reads only from its
standard input file or from files specified as parameters
on the command line.  It is also possible to dynamically
include the contents of any file in the midst of formatting
another.  This aids greatly in the modularization of large,
otherwise unwieldy documents, or in the definition of
frequently used sequences of commands and text.
.pp
The 'source' command is available to dynamically include
the contents of a file:
.be
 [bf .so] <file>
.ee
The parameter <file> is mandatory; it may be an arbitrary
file system pathname, or, as with file names on the command line,
a single dash ("-") to specify standard input.
Environment variables are allowed as components of the pathname.
A pathname component is treated as an envrionment variable if it
starts with a "$".
To get a literal "$" into your pathname, escape it with an "@@" character.
'Swtfmt' will expand all the environment variables, and then treat
the result of the expansion as the file name to be included.
.pp
The effect of a 'source' command is to temporarily preempt
the current input source and begin reading from the named file.
When the end of that file is reached, the original source of input is
resumed.  Files included with 'source' commands may themselves
contain other 'source' commands; in fact, this 'nesting' of
input files may be carried out to virtually any depth.
.pp
'Swtfmt' provides one additional command for manipulating input
files.  The 'next file' command
.be
 [bf .nx] <file>
.ee
may be used for either one of two purposes.  If you specify a
<file> parameter,  all current input files are closed (including
those opened with [bf so]
commands), and the named file becomes the new input source.
You can use this for repeatedly processing the same file,
as, for example, with a form letter.  If you omit the <file>
parameter, 'swtfmt' still closes all of its current input files.
But instead of using a file name you supply with the [bf nx] command,
it uses the next file named on the command line that invoked
'swtfmt'.  If there is no next file, then formatting terminates
normally.
.pp
Neither the [bf so] command nor the [bf nx] command causes a break.
.#
.SH "Output File Control"
The output of the formatter is always written on STDOUT unless you
divert it with the divert output stream command, 'dv'. 
'Dv' can be used to divert swtfmt's output to
a named file:
.be
 [bf .dv] <file>
.ee
All output is written in <file> until a 'dv' command with no
parameter is specified.
'Dv' can also be used to divert output to a temporary file that
can be later read with the 'so' command.  This is useful for
generating tables of contents for documents (see the
"Application Notes" section).
The command
.be
 [bf .dv] N
.ee
diverts output to stream 'N'
and can be read at any time and repeatedly by the command
.be
 [bf .so] N
.ee
Output will be diverted until the the 'dv' command is seen
again without parameters.
(N can be an integer between 1 and 100; the upper limit
may be somewhat less for you --- it depends on
the number of file units that you can have open and the
number of file units that you actually have open at
the time the command is executed).
.pp
The basic difference between the two variants of 'dv'
is that 'dv <file>' opens <file> for WRITE access; <file>
cannot be used as an input file.
'Dv N' opens a temporary file for READ/WRITE access;
therefore,  'so N' causes the temporary file
to be rewound and read.
If the command 'dv N' occurs a second, third, fourth etc.
time, diverted lines are appended to the end of that same
temporary file.
.pp
One final important comment is necessary.  We were 
hesitant to even tell you about 'dv' because of its rather
nasty habit of executing commands instead of diverting
them.
Since it is the only way for you to generate automatic
table of contents we decided to document it.
Just keep in mind that when you want to divert commands,
precede them by a character other than your control
character; you can later designate that character as your control character
before you read the stream.
.#
.SH "Functions, Variables and Special Characters"
Whenever 'swtfmt' reads a line of input, no matter what the
source may be, there is a certain amount of 'pre-processing'
done before any other formatting operations take place.
This pre-processing consists of the interpretation of 'functions',
'variables' and 'special characters'.  A 'function' is a predefined
set of actions that produces a textual result, possibly
based on some user supplied textual input.  For example,
one hypothetical function might be named 'time', and its
result might be a textual representation of the current time
of day:
.be
[time]
.ee
A 'variable' is simply one of 'swtfmt's internal
parameters, such as the current page length or the current
line-spacing value;
the name of each variable is the same as the two-character
name of the corresponding command to set the value of that parameter.
The result of a variable is just a
textual representation of that value.
.pp
A 'special character' is like a function or variable, but its
result is a single character that cannot be conveniently
generated from the keyboard.
.pp
From the standpoint of a user, functions, variables and
special characters are all
very similar. In fact, they are invoked identically
by enclosing the appropriate name, plus any text to be used as arguments,
in square brackets:
.be 3
@[bf This text to be boldfaced]
@[ls]
@[alpha 5]
.ee
Such a construct is known as a "function call."
.pp
When 'swtfmt' sees a function call in an input line, it
excises everything in between the brackets, including the brackets
themselves, and inserts
the results in its place.
Naturally, anything not recognizable is left alone.
If by chance you want the name of a function, variable or special
character enclosed in square brackets included literally as part
of the text, you can inhibit evaluation by preceding the left
bracket with the escape character:
.be
@@@[time]
.ee
Similarly, a right bracket may appear literally inside a function
call when preceded by an escape character:
.be
@[bf @[item 1@@]]
.ee
It is also possible to "nest" function calls so that the results of
one may be used as arguments to another:
.be
@[bf @[ldate]]
.ee
.#
.SH "Number Registers"
The 'number registers' are a group of 200 accumulators (numbered
1-200) on which simple arithmetic operations
may be performed.  They find their greatest use in the preparation
of documents with numbered sections and paragraphs.
Number registers are accessed and manipulated by a special set of
functions. The 'set' function
.be
@[set reg value]
.ee
assigns the integer 'value' to the register 'reg' and yields the
empty string as its result.  The 'add' function
.be
@[add reg value]
.ee
adds the integer 'value' (which, by the way may be positive or
negative) to the register 'reg'.  This function also yields an
empty result.  Finally, the 'num' function
.be
@[num reg]
.ee
yields the current value of the register 'reg' as its result.
In addition, 'reg' may either be prefixed or postfixed by
a plus or minus sign.  If the sign appears before the register
number, the register is incremented or decremented (according
to the sign) by one, [ul before]
the function's result is yielded.  If the sign follows the register
number, though, the register's current value is yielded and then
the register is incremented or decremented.

The following table summarizes the available special characters.
In each case, a positive integer may be included as an argument
following the name to produce multiple instances of the character.
For example, "@[bl 5]" yields five contiguous phantom blanks.
NOTE: in order for the Greek letters and mathematical symbols
to be printed correctly, a post-processor such as 'dprint' (see
Section 1 of the [ul UNIX Programmer's Manual])
and/or special printing equipment is required.

.pp
The special characters marked with an asterisk (*) are only available
on the NEC [bf Spinwriter], and so the output of 'swtfmt' [ul must]
be post-processed with 'sprint'.
.pp
In particular, these characters require that the special
Times-Roman/Mathematics type wheel be in the [bf Spinwriter].
This wheel, in order to accommodate the special characters, lacks certain
of the regular ASCII graphics.  These are substituted for by special
functions. For example, @[scolon] is used to produce a semi-colon.
