.SH NAME
swtfmt \- Software Tools Subsystem ``fmt'' formatter
.SH ORIGIN
Georgia Tech
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B swtfmt
[
.B \-s
] [
.BR \-p <first>[\-<last>]
]  [ files... ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Swtfmt
takes as input a file containing text with interspersed
formatting instructions.
It is invoked by a command with various optional parameters, discussed
below.
The resultant output is appropriately formatted text suitable for
a printer having backspacing capabilities.
The output of
.I swtfmt
is made available on its standard output,
and so may be placed in a file, sent to a line printer,
or changed in any of a number of ways, simply by applying
standard UNIX I/O redirection.
.PP
There are
several optional parameters that may be specified to control
its operation.  The full command line syntax is

.RS
.I swtfmt
[
.B \-s
] [
.BR \-p <first>[\-<last>]
] { <file name> }
.RE

A brief explanation of the cryptic notation:
the items enclosed within square
brackets ("[]") are optional \(em they may or may not be
specified; items enclosed between
braces ("{}") may occur any number of times, including
zero; items enclosed in angle brackets ("<>") designate
character strings whose significance is suggested by the
text within the brackets; everything else should be taken
literally.
.PP
And now for an explanation of what these parameters mean:
.TP
.B \-s
If this option is selected,
.I swtfmt
will pause at the top
of each page, ring the bell or buzzer on your terminal,
and wait for a response.  This feature is for the benefit
of people using hard-copy terminals with paper not having
pin-feed margins.
The correct response, to be entered after the paper is mounted, is a
control-c (hold the 'control' key down and type 'c').
.TP
.BR "\-p" " ..."
This option allows selection of which pages of the
formatted document will actually be printed. Immediately
following the "\-p", without any intervening spaces, should
be a number indicating the first page to be printed.
Following this, a second number may be specified, separated
from the first by a single dash, which indicates the
last page to be printed. If this second number is
omitted, all remaining pages will be produced.
.TP
<file>
Any number of file names may be specified on the
command line.
.I Swtfmt
will open the files in turn, formatting
the contents of each one as if they constituted one big file.  When the
last named file is processed,
.I swtfmt
terminates.  If no
file names are specified, standard input number one is used.
In addition, standard input may be specified explicitly
on the command line by using a dash as a file name.

All the details of
.IR swtfmt 's
operation are beyond the scope of this document.
See the
.I
Software Tools Text Formatter User's Guide
for full details.
The command:
.sp
.RS
swtfmt /usr/local/lib/swtfmt/evp /usr/doc/swtfmt/guide | lpr -b fmt.guide

	or, on the Pyramid,

fos /usr/local/lib/swtfmt/evl /usr/doc/swtfmt/guide
.RE
.sp
will print the guide on the line printer for you.
.SH FILES
.TP
/usr/tmp/fmt.$$.*
temporary files for diversion streams.
.TP
/usr/local/lib/swtfmt/*
standard Software Tools Subsystem macro packages.

.SH DIAGNOSTICS
Self explanatory, and usually fatal.
.SH BUGS
.PP
Since Berkeley UNIX already has a program named
.IR fmt ,
this program has to be called
.IR swtfmt .
This could be confusing for the experienced PRIME user
who is new to UNIX.
.PP
Not everything has been exhaustively tested.
If you have questions or problems, contact
Arnold Robbins (gatech!arnold) who ported
.I swtfmt
from the Georgia Tech Software Tools Subsystem.
